#### **OVERVIEW OF PROJECT:**  

“[britan] is a land of snobbery and privilege, ruled largely by the old and silly” – George Orwell

BRIT of the CASTLE is a singeplayer tower-defence game set with an underlying theme of british politics and power conflict. You play as Mr. Richards, who is a rich old man who doesn't like to share the large benefits he has earnt for himself over the years. He likes his money and a large home for shelter. From his perspective, the "youngins" are invaders who come in a wave-like fashion to try and invade his humble abode, and it is his job to fend against what he thinks is rightfully his. These "youngins" do not think he deserves to horde all his wealth. They want the rich to be taxed, and despite appearing as 'hostile' only want his benefit to be shared across the land for the newer generations to enjoy! So, which side are you on? You don't have a choice.

Build defences, sap youngins, and defend against what's rightfully yours! 

#### **INDIVIDUAL CONTRIBUTION**
Khaan:
My role was to implement the teams ideas and program everything into the game. I made sure that the elements, sprites and characters were implemented in the way we had discussed. I also helped come up with the ideas for the plot and game name. One of the biggest challenges to me when creating this game was having to learn more about game development from scratch. I have previously used game engines to help me create a game, so not having to rely on any graphical user interfaces to help me with designing the world to implement animation and movement was a huge challenge that I have had to overcome. I'd also realised that due to time constraints and programming difficulties I had to cut a lot of things out of our original plans, such as power-ups and multiple levels. This was fustrating but ultimately led to us figuring out how we could make the most out of the elements that we already had. In the end, I feel really proud and confident of my contributions. If I were to do this again I think I would be a lot faster thanks to all the things I have learnt, and have given myself more time with the group to bounce ideas off each other more often!

Levi:
Contribution Overview
- Developed character concepts, from sketches to design, aligning with the Papercraft theme.
- Explored various color palettes, paper textures, and 2D cut-out aesthetics to create a consistent and playful visual tone
- Ensured all characters were visually distinct yet cohesive, maintaining thematic unity while introducing unique traits.
- Research on animation techniques and visual styles not commonly used in previous projects
- Created original animations, tailored specifically to our game world.
- Integrated political elements into the design, inspired by suggestions from Hugh.

One of the most difficult aspects was maintaining the Papercraft theme while designing unique, expressive characters. I have to balance creative freedom with team consistency required frequent iteration and collaboration with developers and map designers

Tyler:

Each team members should write a detailed explanation of their individual contribution to the project.
Be specific: 50% of your mark will be based on your individual contributions, so your marker needs to
know exactly what you contributed. Explain your process and how you went about it. What research did
you do? How did you implement your contributions into the project? What challenges did you face? How did
you overcome these challenges (note: realising that it would be beyond the scope of your project is
not a failure! Explain what you did instead to keep in scope. Balancing your ambitions versus the
practical possibilities within the time and technical constraints is a key skill here!). This should be
detailed and clear, and include *any* contribution you made to the project.

#### **THEMES**
Our main theme will be based around Tower Defence in a Papercraft style. We have a sort of British political theme going on where the tower is an old mans mansion and the enemies are young teenagers who want to share his wealth together. The theme is masked over the style of setting, being in a fantasy world. The player is implied to feel bad about their actions over the facade of a fun video game. 

#### **DESIGN**
The design of the project is largely inspired by tower-defence games like Plants VS Zombies or Bloons TD, except the enemies are set to attack from all around you. You have a tower to defend in the middle of the playing field. You defend by knocking enemies back and building defences against them. 

The design was informed by our understanding of the technical systems we learnt in class, as it uses Javascripts Class and Objects systems and inheritance to make sure the game was designed with modularity and efficency in mind. The Player character plays a big role, including player states and an inventory to interact with the game. We also used the Tile system Hugh taught us, but instead of designing the map around it, we only use it to place weapons and traps throughout the map. 

#### **AESTHETIC DIMENSIONS**
As a group, we ensured parity between the aesthetic, technical and thematic demands of the project by working as we went along. We had big ideas for what we wanted to make, and ensured that they were technically able to implemented by scrapping some things that didn't work, and narrowing things down as we worked closer with the code and gameplay. The fantasy setting is a direct leftover of one of our inspirations originally coming from Shrek, as this was one of our original inspirations when visualising the technical gameplay and characters. 

#### **UNREALISED ASPECTS OF PROJECT**
The game isn't as long as we wanted it to be. We wanted to add many more levels to the game with different variations of enemies and allies, however we were restrictied for time and technical ability as it required a lot more art and coding to achieve. If we were to add this, we would have probably started with the art from Levi, then we would get sounds from Tyler and additional background assets from Gabi to put it all together as we did with the first part of the project. We also didn't go for adding any more powerups or items because we realised those would be too hard to code in terms of the affects they would give, adn the cariation of said effects.
